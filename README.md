# Automated Resume Parsing Using Named Entity Recognition (NER) with NLP

## Introduction
A crucial Natural Language Processing (NLP) method for identifying and categorizing significant information in text is Named Entity Recognition (NER). One of its most useful applications is automated resume parsing, which assists businesses in processing a large number of resumes quickly by locating important information like:

- **Personal Information** (Name, contact details)
- **Education** (Degrees, institutions)
- **Work Experience** (Job titles, company names)
- **Skills** (Technical proficiencies, languages)

The **Resume NER Dataset**, which offers resumes annotated with 36 entity categories, facilitates the building of highly accurate NER models. Businesses can improve efficiency and recruitment decision-making by automating talent acquisition using NER for resume processing.

## Methodology
Several important steps in the structured pipeline are used to achieve automatic resume parsing utilizing Named Entity Recognition (NER) and NLP:

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
The **Resume NER Dataset** from GitHub, which includes resumes labeled with 36 entity types like names, skills, education, work experience, organizations, and locations, is used.

- Named entity recognition (NER) algorithms are trained using this dataset to extract structured data from unstructured resume texts.
- **Preprocessing Steps:**

  - **Tokenization:** Breaking text into individual words, subwords, or phrases.
    - **Methods:**
      - Whitespace Tokenization (splitting by spaces)
      - Punctuation-Based Tokenization (removing punctuation)
      - Subword Tokenization (used in Transformer models like BERT)
    - **Libraries:** `NLTK`, `spaCy`

  - **Lowercasing & Stopword Removal:**
    - Lowercasing standardizes content while eliminating words that don't add value.
    - Stopword removal filters out common words like *is, the, and*.
    - **Example:**
      - Original: "She has experience in data science and AI."
      - After stopword removal: "experience data science AI."
    - **Libraries:** `Scikit-learn`, `NLTK`, `spaCy`

  - **Lemmatization & Stemming:**
    - **Lemmatization:** Converts words to dictionary forms based on meaning.
      - *Example:* "better" → "good", "running" → "run"
    - **Stemming:** Removes suffixes to get word roots.
      - *Example:* "flies" → "fli"
    - **Libraries:** `NLTK`, `spaCy`

  - **Handling Special Characters:**
    - Removes unnecessary symbols (`#`, `@`, `_`, `*`) unless relevant for entity recognition.
    - Retains meaningful symbols like (`.` in *Ph.D.*)
    - **Tool:** Regular expressions (`re` in Python)

### 2. Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model Selection
To extract important resume elements, various NER models are considered:

- **Rule-Based Approaches:** Using handcrafted regex patterns for entity extraction.
- **Machine Learning-Based Approaches:**
  - Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for sequence labeling.
- **Deep Learning-Based Approaches:**
  - **BiLSTM-CRF:** Combines Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with CRF.
  - **Transformer-based Models:** `BERT`, `RoBERTa`, or `SpaCy’s` pre-trained NER models fine-tuned on the dataset.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation
- Dataset is split into **Training, Validation, and Test Sets** (e.g., 80-10-10).
- Model is trained using optimization methods like **Adam Optimizer** and **categorical cross-entropy loss**.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

### 4. Post-Processing and Data Structuring
- Extracted entities are assigned to pre-established categories like Name, Education, and Skills.
- Data is structured in **Database, CSV, or JSON** format for easy HR system integration.

### 5. Deployment and Integration
- The trained model is integrated with **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)** via APIs.
- **Deployment Frameworks:** `Flask`, `FastAPI`, `Django`
- The system is tested on actual resumes for performance improvement.

### 6. Continuous Learning and Optimization
- The model is periodically **retrained** using updated resume datasets.
- **Optimization Techniques:**
  - Hyperparameter tuning
  - Data augmentation
  - Active learning

## Conclusion
Automating resume parsing using NER significantly enhances recruitment efficiency by extracting structured data from unstructured text. With deep learning models like `BERT` and `BiLSTM-CRF`, high accuracy can be achieved. Integration with ATS and continuous retraining further improves performance, making AI-driven hiring a reality.
